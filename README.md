📧 Prompt-Driven Email Assistant (AI + n8n)
This project is an AI-powered email assistant built using n8n, Google Gemini, Buffer Memory, and Gmail integration. It allows users to send emails simply by writing a natural language prompt—no manual drafting or switching tools required.

🔍 Project Overview

“Send a follow-up email to Sarah about our meeting tomorrow,”
and performs the following actions:
